  abstract = {Deterioration of asphalt pavements due to massive load of vehicles and climatic variation has demanded the use of pavements construction material with an excellent resilience characteristic, resistance to permanent deformation, and most importantly, a much longer service lifespan. The main structural distresses in pavement construction are permanent deformation at high temperatures and fatigue cracking under repetitive traffic loadings. To comprehensively investigate the performance of bitumen penetration grade (PG) 70 against rutting, fatigue, and high temperature cracking in hot mix asphalt (HMA) pavements, polycarbonate (PC) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) were used. The investigation of the internal structure, rheological, and physical properties of base and modified bitumen (MB) mixes with different percentages of modifiers (0\%, 2.5\%, and 5\%) by weight were performed via scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern analysis, rolling thin-film oven test (RTFOT), pressurized aging vessel (PAV), dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), rotational viscosity (RV), and bending beam rheometer (BBR). The results of the RV test indicate that modification of neat bitumen with polycarbonate and polytetrafluoroethylene increased the viscosity for polycarbonate-modified bitumen (PCMB), polytetrafluoroethylene-modified bitumen (PTFEMB), and for a blend of PCMB-PTFEMB by 44\%, 50\%, and 55.75\% at 135 °C and 111.10\%, 127.80\%, and 138.88\% at 165 °C, accordingly. BBR test results revealed that modifiers increased the rigidity of neat bitumen by 74.8\%, 75.8\%, and 74.5\% at −16 °C, −22 °C, and −28 °C, respectively.},

The method is based on the Kramers-Kronig relations linking modulus and phase angle of a complex function. Three pure bitumens, one polymer-modified-binder and two mixtures are chosen to validate the possible use of this methodology and apply it. Assumptions which are needed to apply this procedure, are verified on complex-modulus data measured from these materials. Hence, master-curves can be built without introducing error from manual adjustement. The method seems to be suitable for binders and mixtures as soon as their behaviour is in agreement with the time-temperature equivalency principle. In conclusion, some interpretations of the WLF constants are given.},

  abstract = {Anticipation of alternative road binder to replace petroleum derived bitumen requires a deep understanding of relationships between the chemical composition of bitumen and their physical properties, especially rheological ones. The vast number of the different molecules constituting bitumen is too complicated to unravel, thus in this paper we propose to fractionate bitumen into four fractions and study their different physico-chemical properties. The melting temperature and the glass transition of each fractions was determined by DSC while their molecular weight distribution was determined by HS-SEC. Finally, their rheological properties were investigated by DSR. This study highlighted the importance of all bitumen phases: the less polar liquid phase driving the viscous behavior up to −50 °C, the more polar solid phase responsible of the thermal stability and the stiffness, and finally the intermediate viscous oily phases allowing the molecular weight distribution continuity and by consequence allowing to have, on a large temperature range, a viscous liquid behavior at high temperature or low frequency, and an elastic stiff behavior at low temperature. Crystallizable fractions and asphaltene aggregates seemed to act as key molecular structures in the continuous phase.},

  abstract = {With the depletion of the virgin aggregates, many efforts have been oriented towards the recycling of the reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP). However, quality control of the recycled product is required during the manufacture process. This research deals with the use of high-content RAP recycled asphalt mixture composed of 70\% RAP based on experimental and micromechanical approaches. For the experimental part, a "Good" and a "Bad" blended mixture were manufactured in laboratory. Then, rheological measurements of the complex modulus of the different binders and mixtures were carried out. The micromechanical work is based on the generalised self-consistent scheme (GSCS) which was used to predict the mechanical properties of the recycled mixture. This approach aims to homogenize the heterogeneous material by taking into account both the intergranular porosity and the possible interactions between phases. The confrontation of the micromechanical model with the experimental results showed good agreements between measured data and predicted values of the complex modulus of the recycled asphalt. Moreover, it was highlighted from the experimental results that the blending process of the recycled mixture has a great influence on the viscoelastic properties of the recycled mixture. This result was also validated by the GSCS-based approach.},

  abstract = {The description of the mechanical behavior of bitumen on the basis of its microstructure allows its improvement and moreover the development of equivalent or even more sustainable materials with similar properties. For this reasons, a micromechanical model for bitumen is proposed, allowing the description of the viscoelastic bitumen behavior depending on characteristics of different material phases. The definition and demarcation, respectively, of material phases is based on SARA fractions, and polarity considerations that support the assumption of asphaltene micelle structures within a contiguous matrix and the assumed interactions between them. A sufficient number of static creep tests on artificially composed bitumen samples with asphaltene contents from 0 to 30 wt\% served both as identification as well as validation experiments for the developed micromechanical model. An excellent agreement between experimental results and model predictions indicates that the model is able to reproduce significant microstructural effects, such as interactions between asphaltenes, which strongly influence the bitumen behavior. This model is therefore expected to contribute to a better understanding of the influence of the bitumen microstructure on the macroscopic mechanical behavior and subsequently be able to describe the mechanical consequences of microstructural effects like aging.},

In this paper, properties of two PA RAP binders, with and without rejuvenation, were evaluated using quantitative nanomechanical atomic force microscopy (QNM AFM) and performance grading (PG) testing. A model that describes the effect of a bio-rejuvenator on RAP microstructure was developed. A strong correlation was found between the properties measured at nanoscale and macroscale, indicating that the macro properties of RAP binders are driven by the level of polar associations and intermolecular interactions in the bitumen microstructure. This indicates that the microstructures observed in AFM are representative of the bulk properties. Addition of bio-rejuvenator in RAP resulted in the dispersion of polar associations. Finally, it was found that one percent of the rejuvenator can reduce PG critical temperatures by approximately 2 degrees.},

  abstract = {Fine aggregate matrix (FAM) is a phase consisting of asphalt binder, air voids, fine aggregates and fillers. It acts as a primary phase in evaluating the damage and deformation of entire asphalt concrete mixtures. The simplicity, repeatability and efficiency of the FAM testing make it a very attractive specification-type approach for evaluating the performance characteristics of the entire asphalt concrete mixtures. This study explores a linkage in the deformation characteristics between the two length scales: asphalt concrete mixture scale and its corresponding FAM scale. To that end, a simple creep-recovery test was conducted for both mixtures (i.e. asphalt concrete mixture and its corresponding FAM phase) at various stress levels. Test results were compared and analysed using Schapery’s single-integral viscoelastic theory and Perzyna-type viscoplasticity with a generalised Drucker–Prager yield surface. In particular, stress-dependent nonlinear viscoelastic and viscoplastic behaviours were characterised in addition to linear viscoelastic deformation characteristics, because the nonlinear viscoelastic and viscoplastic behaviours are considered significant in asphalt pavements that are subjected to heavy vehicle loads and elevated service temperatures. With a limited scope and test-analysis results at this stage, it was found that there is a strong link between the FAM and asphalt concrete in (linear and nonlinear) viscoelastic and viscoplastic deformation characteristics. This implies that the viscoelastic stiffness characteristics and viscoplastic hardening of typical asphalt concrete mixtures could be estimated or predicted from the simple FAM-based testing-analysis method, which can significantly reduce the experimental–analytical efforts required for asphalt concrete mixtures.},

  abstract = {An oxidative aging treatment in the laboratory by a pressure aging vessel (PAV) is applied on fresh 10/20 and 35/50 bitumens with different thermomechanical properties, in order to simulate long-term aging of bitumen on road pavements. The influence of the aging treatment on bitumen properties is studied as a function of the aging time. Combining Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), the saturate, aromatic, and resin-asphaltene determinator (SAR-AD), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques allows us to confirm that less polar aromatic species are oxidized onto more polar content, and the asphaltene family content is found to increase significantly for more than 75\% after a 45 h PAV treatment. SAXS patterns exhibit a progressive increase in the average size of nanoaggregates (from ∼1.8 to 2.3 nm) and primary clusters (from ∼4.7 to 5.4 nm) after such aging treatment. This is coherent with both the size increase of smaller asphaltene nanoaggregates and the formation of new nanoaggregates by autoassociation of new oxidized asphaltene monomers. As expected, such evolutions of both the asphaltene content and its nanostructure have an influence on macroscopic rheological properties. An analysis of black diagrams and bending beam rheometer (BBR) measurements show that aging induces a shift toward higher moduli at low frequencies coupled with a loss of curvature at intermediate frequencies, meaning lesser susceptibility of aged bitumens regarding thermomechanical solicitation, a loss of viscous behavior at the profit of elastic behavior, and a decrease of the ability to relax stress at low temperatures.},

  abstract = {Poisson’s ratio in viscoelastic solids is in general a time dependent (in the time domain) or a complex frequency dependent quantity (in the frequency domain). We show that the viscoelastic Poisson’s ratio has a different time dependence depending on the test modality chosen; interrelations are developed between Poisson’s ratios in creep and relaxation. The difference, for a moderate degree of viscoelasticity, is minor. Correspondence principles are derived for the Poisson’s ratio in transient and dynamic contexts. The viscoelastic Poisson’s ratio need not increase with time, and it need not be monotonic with time. Examples are given of material microstructures which give rise to designed time dependent Poisson’s ratios.},

This article presents an overview of the current knowledge on the structure of bitumen, and how this organization affects the overall properties. Thanks to known results on model systems such as hard sphere suspensions or, more generally, of two-phase viscoelastic materials (Palierne model), it is possible to describe how mineral or organic additives modify the rheology of paving grade binders. Finally, we describe the way the mechanical properties of the binders are currently used for specification purposes, in the light of the relationships between the properties of the binder and that of the corresponding bituminous mix. This article highlights that paving grade binders are high-tech materials, showing a rich viscoelastic behavior including shape relaxations, whose complexity will undoubtedly fascinate rheologists.},

  abstract = {The use of bitumen as a construction material dates back to antiquity. The materials in use then were mostly naturally occurring in contrast to modern bitumens which have become highly technical artificial materials. This article reviews the current understanding of bitumen structure and the consequences in terms of properties, with a strong emphasis on the rheological properties. The links between chemistry, structure and mechanical properties are highlighted in the framework of an updated colloidal picture of bitumen. It shows that a simple solvation parameter allows quantifying the effect of the asphaltenes on the rheological properties of bitumen. This appears as a promising approach in order to understand more complex phenomena such as bitumen ageing or the diffusion of rejuvenating oils into an older bitumen. From this structural modelling, the effect of several modifiers, such as polymers, acids or mineral fillers, is explained using fundamental results from the mechanics of colloidal suspensions and multiphase materials through the Palierne model. Thus, relevant parameters describing polymer-bitumen or mineral fillers-bitumen interactions can be extracted, as detailed from literature data. In the case of mineral filler, volume fraction is the key parameter but particle size comes also into play when fine fillers are considered. In the case of polymer-modified bitumens, the swelling extent of the polymer controls all other parameters of importance: volume fraction of dispersed phase and mechanical properties of both dispersed and continuous phases. In addition, interesting rheological features due to droplet shape relaxations are described in polymer-modified bitumens. Although a general picture of bitumen structure is shown to emerge, the many fundamental points that remain to be addressed are discussed throughout the paper. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Asphalt binder is a widely used engineering material. It is essentially a nanomaterial with colloidal particles suspended in an oily medium. As asphalt binder ages, the colloidal particles are subject to fundamental physicochemical changes such as agglomeration, which is translated into dramatic engineering property changes of the asphalt binder. In engineering practices, organic rejuvenators are often added to the aged asphalt binder, with the hope of breaking down the nanoparticles and restoring its original engineering properties. However, how the nanoparticles evolve during the aging and rejuvenation of asphalt binder remains hypothetical. This study revealed the fundamental changes of the colloidal particles in asphalt binder during aging and rejuvenation. Moreover, changes in the morphology of colloidal particles are connected to the relaxation spectrum of the asphalt binder. As a result, practitioners do not have to rely on complicated methods and equipment to observe asphalt binders at the microscopic level. Instead, they can employ commonly used engineering tests with a dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) to decipher what occurs at the nanoscale during asphalt binder aging and rejuvenation. This would greatly assist practitioners in material selection and design.},

  abstract = {This paper evaluates the applicability of different shifting techniques for constructing complex modulus master curves using the time-temperature superposition principle (TTSP). A database of complex modulus results of unmodified bitumens, polymer modified bitumens (PMBs), bitumen-filler mastics, unaged and aged bitumens was used together with a Generalized Logistic Sigmoidal Model to assess the validity of seven different shifting approaches. Except for the Laboratoire Central des Ponts et Chaussées (LCPC) method, the construction of master curves was done using the Generalised Logistic Sigmoidal Model and non-linear least squares regression optimization with the aid of the Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet Solver function. The goodness-of-fit for the various shifting techniques and functions was assessed through graphical and statistical methods. From the study, it was found that a numerical shift approach using non-linear least squares produced the best fit between experimental and predicted data in terms of both graphical and goodness-of-fit statistics. The ranking of the other shifting techniques consisted of the LCPC approach, followed by the William, Landel and Ferry (WLF), Modified Kaelble, Viscosity Temperature Susceptibility (VTS), Arrhenius and Log-Linear methods. However, most of the equations are basically empirical and they are not expected to be strictly obeyed by any materials. Discrepancies were still evident, even for the better functions, for those materials that demonstrated a deviation from the thermorheological simplicity of the rheological behaviour as found for highly structured bitumens following high degrees of polymer modification and/or oxidative ageing. © Chinese Society of Pavement Engineering.},

Furthermore, the rejuvenator addition and a high aged binder temperature increase the blending zone length between binders. The carbonyl distribution profile slope assesses also the binders blend quality and directly depends on the aged binder viscosity. Another impacting factor could also influence the binder remobilization and could be based on molecular distributions.},
